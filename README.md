Used Car Quality Detection:

This project aims to predict the quality of used cars using a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of used cars and uses these features to classify the quality of a car. This project is implemented in Python.

Overview:
Determining the quality of a used car is a crucial step for both buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. This project leverages logistic regression to predict the quality of a used car based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, and more. By training the model on historical data, we aim to provide accurate predictions that help users make informed decisions.

Dataset:
The dataset used for training the model is named training.csv and contains various features related to used cars.

Installation:
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-quality-detection.git
cd used-car-quality-detection

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Ensure requirements.txt contains the following packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

5. Usage:
Ensure that the training.csv file is present in the root directory.

Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions:

python car_quality_prediction.py

The script will output predictions for the quality of used cars based on the input features.

Model:
The logistic regression model is used for this classification task. Logistic regression is a popular method for binary and multi-class classification problems. In this project, the logistic regression model is trained on features such as mileage, age, brand, and price of the car.

The steps involved in building the model are:

1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numeric features.

2.Model Training: Train the logistic regression model using the preprocessed data.

3.Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the quality of a used car based on its features.
